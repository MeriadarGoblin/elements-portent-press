		<description>
			<p><i>1st-level ranger feature, which replaces the Natural Explorer feature</i></p>
			<p>When you call, nature's denizens answer and offer you aid. Over the course of 10 minutes, you can conduct a ritual that attracts the attention of a number of beasts within 1 mile of you. At the end of the ritual, a number of Medium beasts equal to 1 + your proficiency bonus gather within 10 feet of you. Your GM determines the beasts that appear, though they can be of a CR no greater than 1/4, and will provide their statistics if necessary.</p>
			<p class="indent">These beasts are friendly to you and your companions, are considered trained mounts, and are considered to be Large beasts for the purposes of determining carrying capacity and what creatures are able to mount them. They can accompany you for 8 hours, until you dismiss them (no action required), or until your allies are attacked by hostile creatures, at which point they use their first turn in combat to buck their rider and take the Dash action to flee.</p>
			<p class="indent">While they accompany you, you gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.</li>
				<li>Your group can’t become lost except by magical means.</li>
				<li>You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to find shelter provided by natural structures.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">At 6th level, the creatures no longer flee when you are attacked and can be used as trained mounts in combat. At 10th level, the maximum CR of these beasts increases to 1.</p>
