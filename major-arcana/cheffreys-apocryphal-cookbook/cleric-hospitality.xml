			<p>To clerics of the hospitality domain, the table is a place as sacred as any temple. They exemplify the warmth that comes with feasting and the beauty of raising crops and livestock to be enjoyed, as championed by gods such as Birgantia, Demeter, Hathor, and Uller. Though they are responsible for the slaughter, they value using every piece of a kill and celebrating the life that is continued in the meals these ingredients create.</p>
			<p class="indent">Many clerics of this domain travel the land preparing meals for those they care for, hunting the biggest game, and searching for the holiest of ingredients; while others preside over great celebrations of harvest.</p>
