			<p>Often ridiculed and misunderstood, occasionally overzealous, paladins that swear the Oath of the Vegan do so for many reasons. Among them, morality, health, impact, but often these reasons appear in differing degrees within the order. Rarely, does one go so far as to swear the oath and care for only one of these reasons though, and that unity binds the order to its tenets.</p>
			<p class="indent">As paladins, these warriors fight to protect nature, health, and animals. While some are more pacifistic than others, they've been known to crusade as vehemently as any other order and rarely shy from expressing their tenets in the way that some paladins choose to remain ambiguous. As adventurers, specifically, they often seek knew plant-based flavors, liberate animals from cruelty, and protect the natural areas through which they travel from poisons both magical and artificial.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">TENETS OF VEGANISM</h5>
			<p>Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of the Vegan vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Plant-based.</i></b> Others may choose to consume animals, but I do not.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Healthy Living.</i></b> My lifestyle fortifies my health, and it is my duty to fortify the health of others.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Cruelty-Free.</i></b> I will decimate those that inflict cruelty upon animals, but I will take no joy in such justice.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Sustainable.</i></b> I do not leave a place less sustainable than I found it. My environmental impact must always be minimal.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Plant Base. </i></b>You can use your Channel Divinity to create a base of safety for you and your allies. Over the course of 10 minutes, you can present your holy symbol and grow a 10-radius dome of plant matter from a point on the ground within 30 feet of you. The dome lasts for 8 hours or until it is destroyed. It has an AC of 16; hit points equal to your Lay on Hands pool; immunity to psychic, necrotic, and radiant damage; resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage; and vulnerability to fire damage. The dome can fit up to 8 Medium or smaller creatures. When a creature you can see enters the dome for the first time, you can use your reaction to grant it 5 hit points, reducing both your Lay on Hands pool and the base's hit points to do so.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Corral Cruelty. </i></b>You can ensure the defenseless suffer no cruelty. When a creature within your reach is targeted with an attack, you can present your holy symbol as a reaction to force the attack to target you instead. If the attack can't reach you, the attack fails.</p>
