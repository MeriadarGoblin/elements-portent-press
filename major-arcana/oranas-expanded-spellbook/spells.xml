				<li>You measure one dimension of the target: its height, width, depth, or perimeter.</li>
				<li>You learn the number of pieces the target is composed of, or the number of objects or creatures the target is holding.</li>
				<li>You learn the target's speed if it has moved since the start of its last turn.</li>

For example, the spell can't inform you that a sword is adamantine if you have never encountered or studied the metal before. If you have no knowledge of the substance, the spell fails.</li>

			<p>Choose two different creatures within range that you can see (one of these creatures can include you); each target must have the same basic arrangement of body parts as the other, and both creatures must be the same size. For the spell's duration, the first creature’s physical appearance and the sound of its voice become that of the second target, and the second target's appearance and voice become the same as the first target’s. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw to resist the identity swap. On a successful save, that creature doesn’t have its appearance or voice changed.</p>
			<p class="indent">The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair. To discern if one of the targets is disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect the target’s appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.</p>

Attempts to navigate using the sky as guidance are made at advantage for any creatures you choose within the spell's area. You can also can cause creatures you choose to have disadvantage on checks to navigate using the sky within the spell's area; if a creature becomes lost while suffering disadvantage this way, you choose the direction it travels for the first mile after becoming lost. You don't need to see a creature or know its location to target it with this effect.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Phantasmagoria.</b> As an action, you cause the sky in a 100-foot-radius area you choose within range to quickly change between night, day, and a series of other appearances you choose. Each creature within that area must make a Wisdom saving throw or be incapacitated for 1 minute. An affected creature can repeat its saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success; once a creature is no longer incapacitated by this spell, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>True Sky.</b> As an action, you change the sky to a condition such as dusk, midday, a new moon, or an eclipse. The illusion is so realistic that it triggers effects or properties within the spell's area that would activate at a certain time of day or at during a certain celestial event (such as a magic item regaining charges at dawn, or a werewolf transforming on the night of the full moon). You can't use this effect again until you cast cosmic canvas again.</p>
			<p class="indent">While the caster concentrates on it, this spell can't end by any means short of a wish. Including the caster in the area of an antimagic field will suspend the effect.</p>

			<p>Choose the corpse of a beast that has been dead for no longer than 10 days, and is of challenge rating 3 or lower. Your spell raises the beast as a zombified version of what it once was that is under your control, returning with all of its hit points. When a beast is raised by this spell, its type becomes Undead, it gains darkvision out to 60 feet, it gains immunity to poison, and it gains a zombie’s Undead Fortitude trait (the GM has the creatures' game statistics).</p>
			<p class="indent">On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature follows it until its task is complete.</p>
			<p class="indent">The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you've given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the challenge rating of a beast you can raise is increased by 1 for each slot level above 4th.</p>

			<p>You fire a 1-inch-wide, 60-foot-long beam of senescent energy that pierces through creatures, objects, and structures alike at untraceable speed. An object or structure pierced by the beam has its AC permanently reduced by 4 if it is inorganic. If it is organic, the point pierced by the beam and the object or structure's material within 1 foot of the beam decays and ages until it is brittle enough to break by a light touch.</p>
			<p class="indent">A creature pierced by the beam must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 10d8 necrotic damage and instantly ages 2d4 x 10 years on a failed save; if this damage would reduce a creature to 0 hit points, it falls unconscious and is stable instead of dying, and it ages an additional year for each point of damage it took in excess of its current hit points. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't aged.</p>
			<p class="indent">The aging can be reversed with the greater restoration spell or more powerful magic, but only if it is cast within 24 hours of failing the saving throw. After that time, only a wish spell can reverse the effect.</p>

			<p>Choose the corpse of a humanoid you can see within range. You momentarily animate the corpse, and it leaps to within 5 feet of a creature of your choice you can see within 30 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 2d8 bludgeoning damage and be grappled by the corpse. A creature grappled in this way takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage at the start of each of your turns, as the corpse's grip tightens. A creature more than one size larger than the corpse automatically succeeds on the saving throw.</p>

			<p>You picture a representation of your divine domain in your mind, such as that of deity's avatar, a powerful creature aligned with the domain, or a physical manifestation of the domain, creating an Illusion of that representation in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. You choose its size, up to Huge, and the Illusion lasts for the spells duration and occupies its space, as if it were a creature.</p>
			<p class="indent">When the Illusion appears, any creatures of your choice that can see it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of it for the duration of the spell. If a creature frightened by the facade ends its turn in a location without line of sight to the Illusion, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success.</p>
			<p class="indent">A hostile creature that moves to a space within 10 feet of the Illusion for the first time on its turn must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. It makes this saving throw at disadvantage if it is frightened. The creature takes 8d10 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.</p>
			<p class="indent">Though the Illusion is tangible, attacks miss it automatically, it succeeds on all saving throws, and it is immune to all damage and conditions. A creature that uses an action to examine the Illusion can determine that it is an Illusion by succeeding on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the Illusion for what it is, the creature can see through it and has advantage on saving throws against its damaging effect.</p>

			<p>You raise walls into existence on flat ground you can see within range. You can shape these walls as you wish, creating a temple, altar, chamber, or a similar structure. The structure must fit within a 120-foot cube, but you decide its layout and appearance, decorated inside as you see fit.</p>
			<p class="indent">The structure must have at least one entrance, taking the form of a door or gateway, and a space of your choice no smaller than a 5-foot cube on the ground within the structure must be occupied by a reflective surface, such as a bowl of water, a mirror, or a crystal ball. The spell creates this surface, and you choose its appearance.</p>
			<p class="indent">Any creature whose blood was used as the material component for the spell's casting can enter the structure freely. While inside the structure, the creature automatically succeeds on ability checks and saving throws made against Illusions, and gains truesight out to a range of 60 feet. When a creature whose blood was not used as the material component for the spell's casting attempts to enter the structure, either through its entrance or via teleportation or extraplanar means, it takes 1d10 force damage and is teleported to an unoccupied but harmless space on the ground up to 15 feet away from the structure.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, you can spend 10 minutes concentrating on the reflective surface within the structure. If you do so, you can cast the scrying spell, without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. When you cast the spell in this way, the target you choose can be on any plane of existence. If the spell succeeds, the reflective surface displays anything you can see via the spell's sensor. When the spell ends, a creature targeted by the spell learns it was being watched, but not your identity.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you use the reflective surface to scry, it shatters, and the structure vanishes as the spell ends. The spell also ends if the structure is targeted by a wish spell, disintegrate spell, or similar magic. The walls of the structure have 150 hit points and are immune to poison and psychic damage.</p>

A charmed creature is unaware of its surroundings and the passage of time. If a charmed creature takes damage or is targeted by a spell, this spell ends for it and its memory is unaffected.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can telepathically affect a target's memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes, provided the creature understands at least one language. You can choose to implant a reshaping of the same event for each target over the course of 1 minute, or a different event for each target over the course of 1 hour. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event. A creature's mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature's memory isn't altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.</p>
			<p class="indent">A modified memory doesn't necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature's natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The GM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.</p>
			<p class="indent">Only a wish spell cast on the target restores the creature's true memory.</p>

			<p class="indent">You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area from being affected.</p>
			<p class="indent">A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves. In addition, as a bonus action on your turn, you can do any of the following while you remain in the rainforest for the duration:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Extend your senses into the forest to learn the location of every creature in the area. Creatures that are hidden from Divination are immune to this effect.</li>
				<li>Direct a vine within the spell's area to lash out at a creature within 30 feet of it that you can see. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be pulled 20 feet directly toward the vine. Alternatively, you can choose for the creature to instead be restrained by the vine until the start of your next turn.</li>
				<li>Use 5 feet of movement to enter a tree and, as part of the move used to enter the tree, either pass into another tree within the spell's area or step out of the tree you're in. You appear in a spot of your choice within 5 feet of the destination tree, using another 5 feet of movement. If you have no movement left, you appear within 5 feet of the tree you entered.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">If you cast this spell over 8 hours, the rainforest fills a 1-mile cube, it gains all of its immediate benefits, and it can't be dispelled except by a wish spell.

			<p>You attempt to horrifically contort the body of a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. Constructs, Oozes, and creatures without a physical body are unaffected. When you cast this spell, choose the nature of the curse from the following options.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You fuse the creature's body into a single writhing mass. While cursed, the target is restrained.</li>
				<li>You cover the creature's eyes and ears with pustulent tumors. While cursed, the target is blinded and deafened.</li>
				<li>You bloat the creature with vitriolic toxins. While cursed, the creature is poisoned, its speed is halved, and if it is reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes, destroying its body and killing it instantly. A creature within 15 feet of the target when it explodes must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 7d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
				<li>You twist the creature's visage into a disgusting sight to behold. While cursed, any creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the target, or enters within 20 feet of it for the first time and can see it, must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the target until the spell ends. A creature can repeat its saving throw if it ends its turn out of line of sight to the target, becoming no longer frightened on a success.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, while cursed, the target takes 3d6 slashing damage at the start of each of its turns as the magic tears and twists its form. A remove curse spell of 5th level or higher cast on the target ends the spell.</p>

			<p>You bind a creature to action, its fate resting on its choice. Choose a creature you can see within range when you finish casting this spell. Then choose a spell that you can cast that is 5th level or lower, has a casting time of 1 action or 1 bonus action, affects one or more creatures, and doesn't require an attack roll.</p>
			<p class="indent">You cast that spell, called the bound spell, as part of casting ultimatum, expending spell slots for both, but the bound spell doesn’t come into effect. Instead, it takes effect, targeting the creature upon which ultimatum is cast, when the target either takes a certain action or fails to take a certain action in a circumstance you describe when you cast the two spells. For example, an <i>ultimatum</i> cast with confusion might stipulate that confusion comes into effect if the target ever speaks of a certain subject.</p>
			<p class="indent">The bound spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then ultimatum ends. The target makes its saving throw against the spell, if any, at the time the circumstance occurs.</p>
			<p class="indent">The bound spell takes effect only on the target of this spell, even if it could normally target more than one creature. You can only have one bound spell active at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of any other <i>ultimatum</i> spell you have cast ends on its target. A <i>remove curse</i> spell will also end the effect on the target.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the bound spell can be one level higher for each slot level above 6th.</p>

			<p>You become the source of great ire for those around you. Each creature within range that can see or hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. An ally automatically succeeds on this saving throw. A creature that fails this saving throw becomes hostile to you for the duration. If the creature was already hostile to you, it instead becomes driven to inflict physical harm upon you, and must use all of its movement on each of its turns to move within reach of you, taking the Dash action if necessary. The only other actions it can take are to attack you as best it can, or escape from an effect preventing it from moving toward you. The spell ends for a creature if it ends its turn unable to see or hear you.</p>

			<p>You amplify your voice and let out a scream or shout when you feel pain, directing and focusing it into a 30-foot-long, 10-foot-wide line in a direction of your choice. Each creature within the line must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d8 thunder damage and is pushed away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed. Unsecured objects that are completely within the spell's area are also pushed 30 feet from you. Regardless of whether a creature succeeds or fails its saving throw, it is deafened until the end of its next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent">This spell's power increases when you are in more pain. If the triggering damage was equal to or greater than half your hit point maximum, or was at least 40 damage, the line is instead 60 feet long, the distance creatures and objects are pushed by the spell is doubled, and the spell deals an additional 1d8 thunder damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

			<p>This spell allows you manipulate plants into moving at your direction. There are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long term benefits.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. Each plant you choose within 20 feet of that point immediately moves to an unoccupied space of your choice within the spell's range. You can also target any Plant creatures you can see within range with this spell, forcing them to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature must immediately use its reaction, if it can, to move up to its speed in a direction of your choice. The creature doesn't move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you cast this spell over 1 minute, you gain sustained control of each plant within the spell's range for 1 hour, requiring concentration. When you cast the spell, and as an action on each of your turns for its duration, you can move all plant-life within the spell's range to an unoccupied space a distance away from the plant equal to or less then the spell's range.</p>
			<p class="indent">A plant can only move to a space capable of sustaining it, such as an area of earth for a tree. A plant's movement doesn't have enough force to cause damage, and if a creature would be surrounded on all sides by plants as a result, it can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it is harmlessly pushed to the nearest unoccupied space outside of the enclosing plants.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>At Higher Levels.</b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the range of the spell increases by 30 feet for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

The symbol also disappears if you or the marked creature dismiss it as an action, or if you cast this spell again. You choose the symbol's appearance, as well as if it is visible to others.
